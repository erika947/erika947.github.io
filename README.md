## Rules 
- The game will need two Players
- It is played on a 3 by 3 Square Grid
- In clasic Tic Tac Toe you have a choice of either being 'X' or 'O'. But the Theme of this game is Under the Sea so the you will have the choice of either a StarFish or a SandDollar.
- Take turns on choosing where you want to click in the squares.
- First Player to get 3 in a row Win!
- If all squares get filled and no one has won then it is a Draw/Tie

### How to Restart the Game once it's over

It is very simple! All you need to do is select the Blue Restart Button that is at the bottom of the page.


### Website Theme

The Theme that I decided to go with is Under the Sea. There are various elements that was added to the website that helped with giving off the vibes.

```
- The background is of the bottom of the Ocean but in a cartoon style.
- Music was added to give some ambience and give of the feeling as if you are under the water.
- The mouse crusor was also changed from the orginal mouse to a little finished
- The Grid where the game is played on is transparent as if to resemble foalting bubbles
- Font was chosen for a bubbly effect as well with a touch of a gradient of Dark Blue to Light Blue.
```
